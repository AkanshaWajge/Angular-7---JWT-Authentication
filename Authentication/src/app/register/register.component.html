<!-- 
    The register component template contains the HTML and Angular template syntax for displaying the form in the browser 
    and binding the form to the properties and methods in the register component above.

The [formGroup]="registerForm" attribute directive binds the form to the registerForm property of the register component.
 When the form is submitted in the browser the [formGroup] directive emits an ngSubmit event that triggers the onSubmit()
  method of the register component. The (ngSubmit)="onSubmit()" event binding attribute binds the ngSubmit event to the 
  onSubmit() method.

Each form input has a formControlName attribute which syncs the form input with the FormControl of the same name in the registerForm.

The [ngClass]="{ 'is-invalid': submitted && f.firstName.errors }" attribute directive adds the is-invalid CSS class to 
firstName input if the form has been submitted and the firstName is invalid (contains errors) based on the validation 
rules defined in the register component. The same [ngClass] directive is used on all of the inputs. The is-invalid class
 is part of Bootstrap 4, it makes the border of the input red to indicate it is invalid.

The div with CSS class invalid-feedback following each input is for displaying validation error messages, the messages
 appear as red text which are styled by Bootstrap 4. The *ngIf="submitted && f.firstName.errors" directive renders the 
 firstName validation messages if the form has been submitted and the firstName is invalid, the same *ngIf directive is
  used for all input validation errors. Within the invalid-feedback div is a child div for each specific error message, 
  the *ngIf="f.firstName.errors.required" renders the message First Name is required if the firstName input is empty. 
  The Validators.required validator is attached to the firstName control in the register component above and has a value 
  of true if the input is empty.

The register button is used to submit the form, the [disabled]="loading" attribute directive disables the button when the 
loading property of the register component is true, a spinner is also displayed in the button while loading with the use 
of the *ngIf="loading" directive. The spinner styling and animation is part of Bootstrap 4.

Lastly the cancel link uses the routerLink="/login" directive to link back to the /login route. The routerLink directive 
uses Angular to navigate between routes using partial page updates. Don't use the standard HTML href attribute because 
it results in a full application reload each time you click a link.
